## 11.01 Scheduling with cron

Terrific! Let's start our journey into automation with an introduction to `cron`, one of the most venerable tools of the Unix world. This mighty wizard tirelessly works in the background, adhering strictly to the schedule dictated by its master. üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚è∞ 

### Understanding `cron` 

`cron` is a time-based job scheduler found in Unix systems. This means, given a time and date, `cron` will dutifully execute the tasks assigned to it. Need to run a backup every Tuesday at 3 am? Want to check system logs for unusual activity every hour? `cron` can handle all these and more, without a hiccup!

### Configuring `cron` with `crontab`

Essentially, `cron` operates by reading files known as *crontabs*‚Äîa shorthand for **cron tables**. The system crontab and user-specific crontabs can vary in their location depending on the system. The command `crontab` is used to modify user-specific crontab. Here's how.

Command to open crontab:
```bash
crontab -e
```

When you run the `crontab -e` command for the first time, it will open a blank file in your default text editor. This is your crontab file. Each line of this file represents a single cron job and follows a particular syntax.

### Crontab Syntax üß©

Here's how you structure a cron job:

```
* * * * *  command-to-be-executed
- - - - -
| | | | |
| | | | ----- Day of the week (0 - 7) (Sunday=0 or 7)
| | | ------- Month (1 - 12)
| | --------- Day of the month (1 - 31)
| ----------- Hour (0 - 23)
------------- Minute (0 - 59)
```

Let's imagine a scenario where we want to run a backup script at 5pm everyday. Here's how we can set it up:

```
0 17 * * * /home/user/scripts/backup.sh
```

This line tells `cron` to run the `backup.sh` script located in the `/home/user/scripts/` directory at 17:00 hours (or 5 pm) everyday.

However, `cron` is not just for daily tasks. It can schedule scripts to run every minute, on a specific day of the month or even a specific month!

### In Conclusion

From making backups to monitoring systems, `cron` is the silent worker bee behind many critical operations in Unix-like systems. It's a powerful ally as you march into the realm of automation. üêùüíº

Remember, the command-line is your playground, and `cron` is just another toy to enhance your game. So, don't hesitate to play around and experiment with this new knowledge! ‚öôÔ∏èüéÆ
