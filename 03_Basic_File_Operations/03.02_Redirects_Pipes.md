# 03.02_Redirects_Pipes: The Power of Redirection and Pipes 🚰

Just as water flows from a faucet, has the potential to pass through various channels and eventually gets directed where it's needed, data too, navigates a similar path in the world of computing. In this section, our exploration will unravel the art of manipulating this data stream and wield the powerful tools of Redirection and Pipes.

## Understanding Redirection ↪️️

Redirection, as the name implies, allows us to steer standard input, output and error streams from their default destinations to those of our choosing.

To better grasp this concept, consider the following example:

```bash
echo "Hello, World!" > hello.txt
```

In this command :

- `echo "Hello, World!"` generates a standard output "Hello, World!".
- `>` operator redirects this output from terminal display to a destination file we've named "hello.txt".
- If "hello.txt" doesn't exist, it's created. If it does exist, the content is overwritten.

### Standard Output (stdout):

The stdout, denoted as '1', is the standard output of a command. If no operator is specified, it prints information on the terminal. As seen in the example above, with the '>' operator, we redirected it to the file "hello.txt".

### Standard Error (stderr):

The stderr, or '2', refers to any error message output by a failed command. Similar to stdout, stderr also displays output on the terminal. Redirecting stderr to a file requires the '2>' operator. This can be extremely useful when diagnosing problems.

```bash
ls non-existent-directory 2> error.txt
```

In this case, the 'ls' command tries to list the contents of a presumably non-existent directory, 'non-existent-directory'. The resulting stderr is redirected to 'error.txt'.

### Standard Input (stdin):

Stdin, a '0', often comes from the keyboard but can also come from files via '<' redirection, much like a reversed '>'.

```bash
sort < file.txt
```
Here, stdin reads from 'file.txt' instead of the keyboard. The 'sort' command organizes its contents alphabetically/numerically.

## Pipes - Connecting Commands 🚰

Imagine, if you could redirect output—not to files, but to other commands. This is where pipes, symbolized as '|' (vertical bar), come in.

Pipes send the output of one command as the input of another, forming a chain of commands where data flows dynamically.

```bash
ls -l | grep ".txt"
```
In this example, 'ls -l' lists detailed directory contents. This output gets piped as input to 'grep ".txt"', which filters and displays only lines containing '.txt'.

## Merging Redirection and Pipes 

Often, you'll merge these tools for complex data manipulation:

```bash
ls -l 2> error.txt | grep ".txt" > files.txt
```
Here, 'ls -l' lists detailed directory contents. Any errors get redirected to 'error.txt'. The rest of the output is piped to 'grep ".txt"', which filters lines containing '.txt' and redirects them to 'files.txt'.

Mastering redirection and pipes make you a proficient sculptor of data, moulding it exactly to your will. Practice, experiment, and don't fear mistakes—every detour is a new lesson learned in the vast landscape of the command-line. 🚀
