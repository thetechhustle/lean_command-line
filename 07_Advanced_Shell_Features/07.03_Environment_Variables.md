## 07.03_Environment_Variables 🌍

In this part of our journey, we're stepping into the realm where your command-line environment bends to your will. Let's unravel the secrets of **environment variables** and learn how to utilize them to master your shell environment. 

Environment variables allow you to customize your shell’s behavior to fit your needs perfectly. Let’s dive into setting these hidden influencers that guide your commands and scripts.

### What are Environment Variables? 🤔

Just like real-life variables, environment variables are dynamic named values that can affect the way running processes behave on a computer. They exist in every operating system, and their types or usage can vary. They can be created, edited, saved, and deleted, and they give information about the system behavior or user preferences.

### How to Display Environment Variables 📖

You can use the `printenv` command followed by the variable name to display the value of an environment variable. For instance, to display the value of an environment variable called `HOME`, you can use the following:

```shell
$ printenv HOME
/Users/YourUsername
```

That takes us to the user's home directory.

### Setting Up a New Environment Variable 🛠️

The `export` command is used to create environment variables. For example, suppose you want to create a variable called `VAR` with the value `Hello, Command-Line`. The command would look like this:

```shell
$ export VAR="Hello, Command-Line"
```
You can then display `VAR` to ensure it was set correctly:

```shell
$ echo $VAR
Hello, Command-Line
```
That's it! You've just created your first environment variable.🎉

### Unsetting an Environment Variable ❌

You can use the `unset` command followed by the name of the environment variable to delete it. For example, to delete the `VAR` environment variable that you just created, use the following command:

```shell
$ unset VAR
```

And voila! Your environment variable is gone.

### Final Thoughts 💭

Mastering environment variables might feel like a small step, but in reality, it opens up limitless possibilities for tailoring your command-line experience. Now, you can dictate how your shell behaves and make it suit your workflow just right. 

Remember, these commands are the strokes that add color to your command-line canvas, transforming it into a vibrant work of efficiency and creativity! 🎨
