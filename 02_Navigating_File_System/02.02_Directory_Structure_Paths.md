### 02.02 Directory Structure and Paths ⚙️

The architecture of a file system can seem daunting initially, just like the twisting streets and alleys of a mysterious ancient city. But once you understand the underlying structure, you'll easily navigate through this maze. Let's introduce the structure and the idea of 'paths.'

#### Understanding File System Hierarchy 🗃️

In UNIX and UNIX-like systems (MacOS, Linux), the file system starts at root, represented as `/`. Every other file and directory on your system is contained within this root directory.

It forms a tree-like structure. Picture branches springing from the trunk, with further branches or leaves stemming from those branches. These branches represent 'directories' and 'subdirectories,' and the leaves stand for 'files.'

Here's a simplified representation:

```
/
├── bin
├── dev
├── etc
├── home
│   └── user
├── lib
├── tmp
└── var
```

Every directory from root is separated by a `/`. So, the complete address (or 'path') of a directory or a file starts from the root.

#### Absolute vs. Relative Paths 🧭

Paths can be **absolute** or **relative**.

- **Absolute Path**: It specifies the location of a directory or file starting from the root. It's like providing a full postal address. For example, `/home/user/documents`.

- **Relative Path**: It specifies the location relative to the current directory. It's akin to giving directions from a known location. For example, from `/home/user`, the `documents` directory can be accessed via `documents` relative path.

#### Using `pwd` Command 🖥️

You can always know your current directory using the `pwd` (Print Working Directory) command:

```
$ pwd
/home/user
```

#### Navigating with `cd` command 🚀

The `cd` (Change Directory) command helps to navigate between directories. You can use both absolute and relative paths. Examples:

- Go to the `documents` directory using relative path (assuming you're in `/home/user`):
   ```
   $ cd documents
   ```

- Go to the `documents` directory using absolute path:
  ```
  $ cd /home/user/documents
  ```

- Go to the home directory with `cd` or `cd ~`.
- Move up one directory level with `cd ..`.
