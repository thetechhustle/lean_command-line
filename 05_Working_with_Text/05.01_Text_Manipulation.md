## 05.01 Text Manipulation: The Sculptor's Tools 🛠

Text manipulation is a fundamental skill that functions as the sculptor's tools when crafting programs or scripts. You are about to take your first steps towards becoming an artisan, molding your cyber creations with precision and grace.

### Cutting Text 🗡

As a sculptor chisels stone, you too will slice through raw text data using the `cut` command. This handy tool allows you to extract a specific field (or fields) from every line of a file, paving the way for swift text transformation:
```bash
cut -d ':' -f 1 /etc/passwd
```
In the above example, the `-d` option sets the delimiter (':'), and the `-f` option selects the field number (1). The outcome is a list of usernames in your system.

### Joining Text 👫

Merging data can ignite new insights. The `join` command will help you combine lines from two files based on a common field:
```bash
join file1.txt file2.txt
```
In this case, information from `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` is merged based on a shared field.

### Formatting Text 📝

Once molded, we must also ensure our text data is presentable. The `fmt` command is a great go-to for text formatting:
```bash
fmt file.txt
```
The command above wraps each paragraph in the `file.txt` to fit the output terminal width.

### Transforming Text 🔀

Finally, we master the art of transformation. The `tr` command can substitute, delete, or compress characters from standard input, writing to standard output:
```bash
echo 'hello' | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]'
```
This command transforms 'hello' to 'HELLO', manipulating the case from lower to upper.

By honing the above skills, you'd have earned the title of a true text sculptor. Practice makes perfect, so it's time to roll up your sleeves and transform lines of raw data into works of art. The symphony of characters is now yours to conduct. Ready to raise your baton? Let's continue our journey, as the world of text awaits! 🎩🔮
